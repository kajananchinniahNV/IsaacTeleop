Quick Start
===========

This guide walks through running a teleoperation session with an XR headset using CloudXR. By the
end you will have the retargeting pipeline processing live hand/controller data and printing gripper
commands to the terminal.

.. contents:: Steps
   :local:
   :depth: 1

1. Check out code base (Optional)
---------------------------------

Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop.git
   cd IsaacTeleop

As a quick start guide, we don't need to build the code base from source. However, we still need
to clone the repository for a couple quick samples to run.

2. Install the ``isaacteleop`` pip package
------------------------------------------

In a new terminal, install the package from PyPI (or from a local wheel if you built from source):

.. code-block:: bash

   # From PyPI
   uv pip install isaacteleop[cloudxr,retargeters]~=1.0 --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com

Instead of installing the package from PyPI, you can build from source and install the local wheel.
See :doc:`build_from_source` for more details.

.. _run-cloudxr-server:

3. Run CloudXR Server
---------------------

Start the CloudXR runtime. The first run downloads the CloudXR Web Client SDK
and asks you to review and accept the EULA:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr

You should see output similar to:

.. code-block:: text

   NVIDIA CloudXR EULA must be accepted to run. View: https://github.com/NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop/blob/main/deps/cloudxr/CLOUDXR_LICENSE

   Accept NVIDIA CloudXR EULA? [y/N]: y

   INFO [logServiceInfo] Created CloudXR™ Service
         version: 6.1.0
         tag: 6.1.0-rc2
         outputDir: /home/dev/.cloudxr/logs
         logFile:   /home/dev/.cloudxr/logs/cxr_server.2026-03-09T234239Z.log
         uses: Monado™

   CloudXR runtime started, make sure load environment variables:

   ```bash
   source /home/dev/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env
   ```

   CloudXR WSS proxy: running
         logFile:   /home/dev/.cloudxr/logs/wss.2026-03-09T234239Z.log

.. important::

   Keep this terminal open — CloudXR must stay running for the duration of the session. Open a
   **new terminal** for the remaining steps.

   Also take note of the ``source /home/dev/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env`` path it mentioned in the
   output. You will need to source it in step :ref:`load-cloudxr-environment-variables`.

CloudXR Configurations (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also inspect the CloudXR environment variables by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   cat ~/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env

You should see:

.. code-block:: text

   export NV_DEVICE_PROFILE=auto-webrtc
   ...

By default, the CloudXR runtime is configured to use the ``auto-webrtc`` device profile for Pico &
Quest headsets. For Apple Vision Pro, the runtime is configured to use the ``auto-native`` device
profile.

To do that, you can override CloudXR configurations by creating an ``env`` file and pass it to the
CloudXR runtime via the ``--cloudxr-env-config`` argument.

.. code-block:: bash

   echo 'NV_DEVICE_PROFILE=auto-native' > vision_pro.env
   python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr --cloudxr-env-config=./vision_pro.env

Again, you can also inspect the CloudXR environment variables by looking at the
``~/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env`` file:

.. code-block:: bash

   export NV_DEVICE_PROFILE=auto-native
   ...

4. Whitelist ports for Firewall
-------------------------------

CloudXR requires certain network ports to be open. Depending on your firewall configuration, you
might need to whitelist them manually. For **Quest and Pico headsets** (WebXR Client), at the
minimum, you need to whitelist the ports for the CloudXR runtime and wss proxy:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo ufw allow 47998/udp && sudo ufw allow 49100/tcp && sudo ufw allow 48322/tcp

If you are running the WebXR client from source, you need to whitelist the additional ports for the
web server:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp && sudo ufw allow 8443/tcp

Please see the `CloudXR network setup`_ for more details for other network configurations (such as
running the CloudXR runtime and wss proxy in containerized environment; or using Vision Pro cilent).

5. Connect an XR headset
------------------------

.. _connect-quest-pico:

Meta Quest and Pico headsets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To stream from a Meta Quest or PICO headset, you will need a CloudXR web client. For your
convenience, we host a prebuilt CloudXR web client at `nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/client`_.
You can just open this URL in your headset's browser to connect to your headset. No need to build
or insetall a separate client.

.. tip::

   For quick validation, you can also open the `nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/client`_ URL in a
   desktop browser. IWER (Immersive Web Emulator Runtime) will automatically load to emulate a Meta
   Quest 3 headset.

.. figure:: ../_static/cloudxr-web-client-howto.png
   :alt: CloudXR web client usage instruction
   :align: center

   **Figure:** CloudXR web client usage instruction

As illustrated in the figure above, there are 3 steps to connect to your headset:

1. Enter the IP address of the workstation running CloudXR
2. Accept the self-signed SSL certificate (created automatically for you during :ref:`run-cloudxr-server`)
3. Click "CONNECT"

.. note::
   For advanced usage and troubleshooting of CloudXR, see the `CloudXR documentation`_ for more
   details.

The source code for the web client is in the :code-dir:`deps/cloudxr/webxr_client/` directory. Follow
the instructions in the official `CloudXR.js documentation`_ for more details if you want to run the web client from source.
for more details if you want to run the web client from source.

.. _connect-apple-vision-pro:

Apple Vision Pro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For Apple Vision Pro, you will need to build and install the Isaac XR Teleop Sample Client. Follow
the instructions in the `Isaac XR Teleop Sample Client for Apple Vision Pro`_ repository to build
and install the sample client on your Apple Vision Pro.

.. note::

   You will need v3.0.0 or newer of the `Isaac XR Teleop Sample Client for Apple Vision Pro`_
   to connect to Isaac Teleop.


.. _load-cloudxr-environment-variables:

6. Load CloudXR environment variables
--------------------------------------

Open a new terminal and source the CloudXR environment variables posted from the CloudXR runtime in
:ref:`run-cloudxr-server`:

Source the setup script so that the OpenXR runtime points to CloudXR:

.. code-block:: bash

   source ~/.cloudxr/run/cloudxr.env

.. important::

   Make sure to run the rest of the commands in the same terminal. Or if have to open a new
   terminal, source the CloudXR environment variables again.

7. Run a teleop example
-----------------------

Run the simplified gripper retargeting example. This demonstrates the full
pipeline: reading XR controller input via CloudXR, retargeting it through the
``GripperRetargeter``, and printing the resulting gripper command values:

.. code-block:: bash

   python examples/teleop/python/gripper_retargeting_example_simple.py

Once running, squeeze the controller triggers on your XR headset to control
the gripper. You should see periodic status output:

.. code-block:: text

   ============================================================
   Gripper Retargeting - Squeeze triggers to control grippers
   ============================================================

   [  0.5s] Right: 0.00
   [  1.0s] Right: 0.73
   [  1.5s] Right: 1.00
   ...

The example runs for 20 seconds and then exits. To try other examples, see
``examples/teleop/python/`` — for instance:

- ``se3_retargeting_example.py`` — maps hand or controller poses to
  end-effector poses (absolute or relative)
- ``dex_bimanual_example.py`` — bimanual dexterous hand retargeting
- ``gripper_retargeting_example.py`` — full gripper example with more
  configuration options
