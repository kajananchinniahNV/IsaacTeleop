## Overview

**Isaac Teleop**: The unified standard for high-fidelity egocentric and robot data collection.
It is designed to address the data bottleneck in robot learning by streamlining device integration;
standardizing high-fidelity human demo data collection; and foster device & data interoperability.

## Key Features

### Unified Stack for Sim & Real Teleoperation

- A single framework that works seamlessly across simulated and real-world robots, ensuring
streamlined device workflow and consistent data schemas.
- Currently supported robotics stacks:
  - **ROS2**: Widely adopted middleware for robot software integration and communication
  - **Isaac Sim**: Simulation platform to develop, test, and train AI-powered robots
  - **Isaac Lab**: Unified framework for robot learning designed to help train robot policies

  - **Isaac OS**: Enterprise-ready robotics operating system (in early access)
  - **Isaac Arena**: Isaac Lab extension for large-scale evaluation and resource orchestration

### Standardized Device Interface

- Provides a **standardized interface** for teleoperation devices, removing the need for custom
device integrations and ongoing maintenance.
  - Currently supported device categories:
    - **XR Headsets** (with spatial controllers): Vision Pro, Pico, Quest
    - **Gloves**: Manus
    - **Foot Pedals** (hands-free lower body control): Logitech Rudder Pedal
    - **Body Trackers**: Pico Motion Tracker
  - Upcoming device categories:
    - **Master Manipulators**: TBA
    - **Exoskeletons**: TBA
- Easily extend support for additional devices through a **plugin system**, enabling quick
integration of new hardware.

### Flexible Retargeting Framework

- Retarget the standardized device outputs to different embodiments.
- [Reference retargeter implementations](src/core/retargeting_engine/python/retargeters/),
including popular embodiments such as Unitree G1.
- [Retargeter tuning UI](src/core/retargeting_engine_ui/python) to facilitate
live retargeter tuning.

### Teleoperation Use Cases

- Currently supported use cases
  - Use XR headsets for gripper / tri-finger hand manipulation
  - Use XR headsets with gloves for dex-hand manipulation
  - Seated full body loco-manipulation (Homie)
  - Tracking based full body loco-manipulation (Sonic)
- Upcoming use cases
  - Egocentric data collection (aka “no-robot”)
  - Teleoperate cloud based robotics simulations
  - Remote teleoperation with immersive camera streaming to XR headsets

### One time setup

1. Request [CloudXR SDK Early Access](https://developer.nvidia.com/cloudxr-sdk-early-access-program/join)

2. Install Docker by following the [public guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu)

3. Install [NGC CLI tool](https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/installers/cli)

4. Configure your [NGC API key](https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-keys)

5. Verify you have access to all the artifacts
```
ngc registry resource list "nvidia/cloudxr-js-early-access"
ngc registry image list "nvidia/cloudxr-runtime-early-access"
```

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Install uv** (if not already installed):

We strongly recommend using `uv` for dependency management and Python virtual
environment.  Other solution should also work, but your mileage may vary.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Create UV virtual environment**

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11 venv_isaacteleop
source venv_isaacteleop/bin/activate
```

3. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:NVIDIA/IsaacTeleop.git
cd IsaacTeleop
```

> **Note**: Dependencies (OpenXR SDK, pybind11, yaml-cpp) are automatically downloaded
> during CMake configuration using FetchContent. No manual dependency installation or
> git submodule initialization is required.

4. **(Optional) Pre-download CloudXR Runtime SDK**

If you are using the default flow, skip this step and run step 6.
`./scripts/run_cloudxr.sh` automatically downloads both CloudXR SDKs.

Use this step only if you want to pre-download the Runtime SDK manually:

- Download via script (NGC default):
  ```bash
  ./scripts/download_cloudxr_runtime_sdk.sh
  ```
- Or place local tarball in `deps/cloudxr/`:
  `CloudXR-<version>-Linux-<arch>-sdk.tar.gz`
- Version is controlled by `CXR_RUNTIME_SDK_VERSION` in `deps/cloudxr/.env.default`.

5. **(Optional) Pre-download CloudXR Web SDK**

If you are using the default flow, skip this step and run step 6.
`./scripts/run_cloudxr.sh` automatically downloads both CloudXR SDKs.

Use this step only if you want to pre-download the Runtime SDK manually:

- Download via script (NGC default):
  ```bash
  ./scripts/download_cloudxr_sdk.sh
  ```
- Or place local tarball in `deps/cloudxr/`:
  `cloudxr-web-sdk-<version>.tar.gz`
- Version is controlled by `CXR_WEB_SDK_VERSION` in `deps/cloudxr/.env.default`.

6. **Run CloudXR**
```bash
./scripts/run_cloudxr.sh
```

The `./scripts/run_cloudxr.sh` script will automatically:
- Download the CloudXR Runtime SDK (if not already present)
- Download the CloudXR Web SDK (if not already present)
- Build the necessary Docker containers (wss-proxy, web-app)
- Start all CloudXR services

> **Note:** The first run may take a few minutes to download the SDK and build containers.
> Subsequent runs will be faster as these are cached.

#### Alternative: run CloudXR via local wheel

If you prefer a non-Docker runtime/proxy flow, you can launch CloudXR and the WSS
proxy together with:

```bash
./scripts/run_cloudxr_via_wheel.sh
```

This script runs the Python CloudXR runtime (`python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr`) and
the Python WSS proxy (`python -m isaacteleop.cloudxr.wss`). If those modules are
not importable in the current Python environment, it tries to bootstrap
`isaacteleop[cloudxr]` from local wheels in `install/wheels` (or `build/wheels`).
If no local wheel is found, the script will build and install one automatically.

After the script starts, open a CloudXR.js client page.

For convenience, you can use the hosted NVIDIA Isaac Teleop Web Client:
`https://nvidia.github.io/IsaacTeleop/client/`

In that page, set **Server IP** to your server IP (for example, `192.168.1.2`).

7. **White list ports for Firewall**

Open the [required CloudXR ports](https://docs.nvidia.com/cloudxr-sdk/latest/requirement/network_setup.html#ports-and-firewalls).

If you are running the web client on this machine:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 47998/udp && sudo ufw allow 49100/tcp && sudo ufw allow 48322/tcp && sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp && sudo ufw allow 8443/tcp
```

If you are not running the web client locally you only need the ports for the runtime and proxy:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 47998/udp && sudo ufw allow 49100/tcp && sudo ufw allow 48322/tcp
```

8. **WebXR Client Setup**

The last step will run a couple docker containers and one of them is the WebXR server. It can be
accessed via the browser on your HMD support (Quest 3 or Pico 4 Ultra).

- Local: `https://localhost:8443` or `http://localhost:8080`
- Network: `https://<server-ip>:8443` or `http://<server-ip>:8080`

> **Tips:**
> - For rapid development and debugging, we recommend testing your CloudXR.js application on a
>   desktop browser before deploying to XR headsets.
> - For Pico 4 Ultra, Pico OS 15.4.4U or later is required.
> - HTTP mode is easier to use, but currently is not supported by

### CloudXR Configurations (Optional)

You can override CloudXR configurations by creating a `.env` and place it next
to `deps/cloudxr/.env.default`. The folder structure should look like:

```bash
$ tree -a deps/cloudxr/
deps/cloudxr/
├── CLOUDXR_LICENSE
├── .env
├── .env.default
└── .gitignore
```

### Install & Run Isaac Lab

Isaac Tepeop Core is design to work side by side with [NVIDIA Isaac Lab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab). We recommend the [Installation using Isaac Sim Pip Package](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/pip_installation.html) method for Isaac Lab.  Please refer to Isaac Lab's [Installation](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html) guide for other advanced methods. Here are the quick steps to do so.

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
source venv_isaacteleop/bin/activate
uv pip install "isaacsim[all,extscache]==5.1.0" --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com
uv pip install -U torch==2.7.0 torchvision==0.22.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

2. **Clone & install Isaac Lab**

Run this outside of the `IsaacTeleop` code base.

```bash
# In a separate folder outside of Isaac Teleop:
git clone git@github.com:isaac-sim/IsaacLab.git

# Run the install command
cd IsaacLab
./isaaclab.sh --install

# Set ISAACLAB_PATH, which will be used later in `run_isaac_lab.sh`.
export ISAACLAB_PATH=$(pwd)
```

### Build Isaac Teleop and Run Isaac Lab Sample
